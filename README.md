# AI-Powered Dyslexic Learner Support App

## Project Overview

This project is a **web-based application** designed to support dyslexic learners by leveraging AI and NLP technologies. The app provides a dyslexia-friendly interface to help users read, write, and learn more effectively through personalized, adaptive features. Key capabilities include text-to-speech, speech-to-text, AI-based text simplification, a friendly conversational chatbot, and adaptive quizzes.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts text input into clear, slow-paced audio tailored for dyslexic learners.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Allows users to dictate answers and notes which are transcribed into editable text.
- **Text Simplification:** Uses AI to rewrite complex text into simpler, easy-to-understand language along with keyword highlighting.
- **Conversational Chatbot:** An empathetic AI chatbot helps with learning guidance, encouragement, and interaction.
- **Adaptive Quiz System:** Generates quizzes from learning content with difficulty adjusting based on user performance.
- **Progress Dashboard:** Visualizes learner progress with personalized recommendations and motivational feedback.
